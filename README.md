Tomcat Deployment Script README
This script is designed to automate the deployment of Apache Tomcat on an AWS EC2 instance using Ansible. It allows you to choose the version of Tomcat to install, specify user credentials, and assign roles for Tomcat management. This README provides an overview of how to use the script and its functionality.

Prerequisites
Before using this script, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

Linux Environment: This script is designed to run on a Linux environment, specifically using the Bash shell.

Curl: Ensure that Curl is installed on your system, as it is used to retrieve the latest Tomcat version and download the installation package.

Ansible: You must have Ansible installed and configured on your machine. Ansible is used to automate the deployment process.

Getting Started
Clone or download the script to your local machine.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

Make the script executable by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x your_script_name.sh
Usage
Run the script by executing the following command:

bash
Copy code
./your_script_name.sh
The script will guide you through the deployment process with the following prompts:

It fetches the latest Tomcat version from the Apache Tomcat website.

You can specify the Tomcat version you want to install. If you press Enter without specifying a version, it will use the default version.

Provide your desired username and password for Tomcat's manager-gui and manager-script roles.

Specify the desired roles for Tomcat (manager-gui, manager-script, etc.), separating each role by a comma.

The script then proceeds to deploy Tomcat on your AWS EC2 instance using Ansible.

Notes
If the script doesn't find the specified Tomcat version, it will prompt you to choose a different version.

If you don't specify a version, the script will use the default version.

The script disables Ansible's host key checking to prevent SSH connection issues when deploying on AWS EC2 instances.

The Ansible playbooks used for deployment are createc2.yaml and deploytomcat.yaml.
